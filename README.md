Bringing the funk to functional languages

This repo is for my endeavors into functional languages.  As time permits, I will upload my explorations and any interesting applications I dream up.  For now, that includes a lotus sudoku solver, which was a final project for one of my classes.



####decryptMorse.hs
Given an "encrypted" message (simple cipher and morse code), this will translate it to the original message


####lotus_sudoku.hs
This solves a lotus style sudoku puzzle, given an array representing the starting puzzle.  We originally wrote it to solve all possible puzzles, but it was far too slow for puzzles with only a few entries filled in.
